Instructions:

1. Extract all the files (.m extension) to a single folder/location
2. Open epm.m and excecute the code (or press F5), by default the code will calculate and plot Silicon bandstructure.

---------

Notes:

i.) the folder to which you extract the files must be included in the MATLAB execution path,
   this shouldn't be a problem for recent versions of MATLAB. 
   For old version of MATLAB e.g. v.5 it is safer to extract the files fo the MATLAB "work" directory.

ii.) if any webpages are no longer availabile, it might be possible to have a look at a copy of it through the 
     Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org)

iii.) the plotted bandstructure is unshifted (note: maximize the window for a better view)


iv.) the Form Factors values are in Vpsuedo.m ,if you want to calculate the bandstructure for some other materials,
    some adjustments to the code are needed.

Comments:

this code was done as a computational project/excercise for a lecture relevant to semiconductor physics.
I found a very good excercise, especially since I wasn't familiar with Mathematica (ref.1, code readily availabile)
so figuring the code flow was annonying. The FORTRAN code helped in clearing this a bit (ref.2).

Many thanks to the authors in Ref.1 & Ref.2, especially Dr.Danner for his online tutorial.

I would like to thank as well Prof.Peter Vogl for his awesome lecture, it was truely inspirational.

Ref.2 (Welsher): http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2007/ap272/welsher1/
-Empirical Pseudopotential Form factors are from Marvin L. Cohen and T.K. Bergstresser,
"Band Structures and Pseudopotential Form Factors forFourteen Semiconductors of the Diamond and Zinc-blende Structures,”
 Phys. Rev. 141, 2, p. 556, 1966.

I hope for the next version I would include graphical flowchart.
