## Computational_Physics_J.M.Thijssen
Here are my implementaions of the programs using Matlab in the book Computational Physics by J. M. Thijssen. I used MatlabR2019b to test and run all the codes.     

J. M. Thijssen also provided his implementations using [Fortran](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/physics/mathematical-methods/computational-physics-2nd-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521833462).

In Chapter5, I heavily took the ideas from Thijssen's implementations, especially the implementation to solve Poisson's equation using the Numerov algorithm.
