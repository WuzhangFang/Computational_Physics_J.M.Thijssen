## Computational_Physics_J.M.Thijssen
Here are my implementaions of the programs using Matlab in the book Computational Physics by J. M. Thijssen. I used MatlabR2019b to test and run all the codes.     

J. M. Thijssen also provided his implementations using [Fortran](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/physics/mathematical-methods/computational-physics-2nd-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521833462).

### Chapter5
I heavily took the ideas from Thijssen's implementations, especially the implementation to solve Poisson's equation using the Numerov algorithm.

### Chapter6
- APW is not working and the generation of Legendre polynomials is very slow in Matlab.    
- Empirical Pseudopotential Method (EPM): the band structure of silicon depends on the G-Vectors very much. Need to think about how to generate G-Vectors well.
